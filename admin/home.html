						<p>
							Welcome a bord! Thank you for choosing Noobz Appz' Webstore. <br>
							On this page, you will find all the necessary information to get you started.
							Below are the information about all the modules and how to use them. <br>
							Let's get started by clicking on the &#9776; icon on the top left of your screen.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="Brands-desc">
						<h3>Brands</h3>
						<p>
							This is where you start! You must start by creating the brands of the products on your web shevles.
							This will help your customers to search their products they want to find by filtering their favorite brands.	
						</p>
						<p>
							Click on the &#9776; icon and click on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Brands</span>.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="Products-desc">
						<h3>Products</h3>
						<p>
							Once you have the brands you can now start to add your products to your online store. From there you can manage the display class of each product such as Trending, Featuring, Discount and New Arrival. 
							<br><br>
							<span style="font-weight: bold">Trending:</span> You can choose 6 products to display as trending. The images of the chosen products will be displayed in a glider on the top of the screen. Be sure that you choose the best images of each product as main image as this is the section that the clients will see first when they look your store page. 
							<br><br>
							<span style="font-weight: bold">Featuring:</span> Any products for which you applied discount in products price will be displayed in that section which will be right below the glier gallery. The percentages of discount will be written in red on the products.
							<br><br>
							<span style="font-weight: bold">Featuring:</span> You can choose unlimited amount of products in that section. It is just a way to showcase your product without giving any discount. 
							<br><br>
							<span style="font-weight: bold">New Arrivals:</span> For this section, you don't need to do anything. Only 12 newest products will be displayed in that section.
							So if there is an old product that you wish to push the sale, it is important that the product in question is marked as <span style="font-weight: bold">Featuring</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">Trending</span>. I would advise not to push all your products as featuring though.
							<br>
						</p>
						<p>
							Click on the &#9776; icon and click on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Products</span>.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="Delivery_Zone-desc">
						<h3>Delivery Zones</h3>
						<p>
							Now that your product is ready, you need to set up delivery zones. You just need to enter the name of the city, the township, and the delivery fees for each area.
							You would also need to precise whether you deliver directly to home or to bus station depending on the city. 
							When your online clients will enter their address and choose a city and township in the booking form, the delivery fees will be automatically added to the invoice.
						</p>
						<p>
							Click on the &#9776; icon and click on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Delivery Zones</span>.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="Orders-desc">
						<h3>Orders</h3>
						<p>
							This is the module where you keep track of your orders. You don't need to do anything in term of data entry here. Your clients will order some products on your store and check out. All the orders will be displayed here with the following infos: name, address, city, phone, delivery notes and the products they order. You just need to view the order and check for clients payments and prepare the deliveries. You can give them a call to inform them about the delivery dates etc... 
						</p>
						<p>
							Click on the &#9776; icon and click on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Orders</span>.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="Payments-desc">
						<h3>Payments</h3>
						<p>
							Here you check all the payments that your clients are processing after making their orders. <br>
							Everytime a client places an order in your webstore, an invoice in PDF (Portalbe Document Format) is generated for them to download. Since the invoice includes your bank or financial institude details (KBZ pay, Wave Money etc...), your client can process the payment and submit a copy of the payment (screen shots of payments and bank slips) through the link that is provided on the invoice. 
							Your task would be do view all the documents submitted by your clients and check with your financial institute or your bank accout. Once, a payment is in order, you can update the status by chaning into 'Paid' and input the method of payment and the date of the payment. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Click on the &#9776; icon and click on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Payments</span>.

					<div class="Invoice-desc">
